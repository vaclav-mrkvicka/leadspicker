# Leadspicker Personalizer

Generates short personalization fragments for cold email campaigns in Leadspicker projects
via the magic-columns API. Each column runs GPT-4o-Mini on every contact to produce a brief,
natural sentence fragment or grammar-correct salutation.

This skill is a companion to `leadspicker-data-enrichment` (provides the input data) and
`leadspicker-classifier` (classifies and filters contacts). It uses the enriched data
(company descriptions, website summaries, LinkedIn profiles, posts) as input for
personalization prompts.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Leadspicker never generates full messages — only short parts.**

Every personalization output is a short sentence fragment (typically **14-16 words**). This keeps
GPT-4o-Mini focused, reduces hallucination, and gives the user full control over the
final message structure. The exact word limit can be adjusted per request.

Examples of what this skill produces:
- `"I saw your company specializes in AI-powered sales automation"` (website hook)
- `"I noticed your recent post about hiring challenges in tech"` (icebreaker)
- `"Dobrý den, pane Nováku"` (Czech salutation)
- `"Tomáši"` (Czech first name vocative)

These fragments are inserted into message templates alongside static text the user controls.

---

## User Input

Always collect (or confirm you have) these parameters before making any API calls:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `project_id` | Leadspicker project ID | `29842` |
| `api_key` | User's API key (`x-api-key`) | `fd1f0d98...` |
| Personalization request | What hook or greeting to generate | `"website hook in Czech"` |
| `column_name` | Name for the new column | `"Website Hook - CZ"` |
| Output language | Language for the output (default: English) | `"Czech"`, `"German"`, `"Polish"` |

If the user doesn't provide a `column_name`, generate one from the personalization type
and language (e.g., `"Website Hook"`, `"CZ Salutation"`, `"Icebreaker - DE"`).

---

## System Prompt (Fixed — Do Not Modify)

Every AI column in Leadspicker is wrapped by a fixed system prompt that you **cannot change**.
All personalizations use **string mode** (`is_boolean: false`).

```
System forces output: {"result": "response"}
```

**What this means for your prompts:**
- NEVER include output format instructions — the system prompt handles JSON
- Just describe the task, the rules, and provide the input variables
- The system prompt will wrap your output in `{"result": "..."}` automatically
- All personalization prompts use `is_boolean: false`

---

## Personalization Types

### A. Company-Based Hooks

Short sentences referencing what the company does. Use when the email opens with
a reference to the recipient's company.

#### Website Hook

References what the company does based on their website content. **Always include
`{{linkedin_company_description}}` as a fallback** — when website data is empty, LinkedIn
fills the gap and ensures every contact gets a hook.

**Variables:** `{{company_name}}`, `{{website_text_summary}}`, `{{linkedin_company_description}}`
**Typical output:** `"I saw your company helps retailers optimize their supply chain"`

#### LinkedIn Company Hook

References the company's LinkedIn description — often more focused on mission/positioning.

**Variables:** `{{company_name}}`, `{{linkedin_company_description}}`
**Typical output:** `"I noticed your team is building AI tools for sales teams"`

#### Combined Company Hook

When both website and LinkedIn data are available, uses both for richer context.

**Variables:** `{{company_name}}`, `{{company_website}}`, `{{linkedin_company_description}}`, `{{website_text_summary}}`
**Typical output:** `"I saw that you're helping e-commerce brands scale through automation"`

### B. Person-Based Hooks

Short sentences referencing the person's role, experience, or activity.

#### Experience Hook

References the person's background, current role, or career trajectory.

**Variables:** `{{full_name}}`, `{{position}}`, `{{linkedin_about_me}}`, `{{present_experiences}}`
**Typical output:** `"With your experience leading sales teams at enterprise companies"`

#### LinkedIn Posts Icebreaker

References something the person recently posted about on LinkedIn.

**Variables:** `{{linkedin_latest_posts}}`
**Typical output:** `"I noticed your post about the challenges of scaling outbound"`

#### Education/Skills Hook

References the person's education or specific expertise.

**Variables:** `{{full_name}}`, `{{education_summary}}`, `{{linkedin_skills}}`
**Typical output:** `"With your background in data science and machine learning"`

### C. Language-Specific Columns

Grammar-aware columns for languages with formal address, vocatives, or declension.

#### Salutation

A complete formal greeting with properly declined name.

**Variables:** `{{full_name}}`, `{{position}}`
**Czech example:** `"Dobrý den, pane Nováku"` / `"Dobrý den, paní Nováková"`
**German example:** `"Sehr geehrter Herr Schmidt"` / `"Sehr geehrte Frau Müller"`
**Polish example:** `"Szanowny Panie Kowalski"` / `"Szanowna Pani Kowalska"`

#### First Name Vocative

The first name declined into the vocative case (5th grammatical case).

**Variables:** `{{first_name}}`
**Czech example:** `"Tomáši"` from Tomáš, `"Kateřino"` from Kateřina
**Polish example:** `"Tomaszu"` from Tomasz, `"Katarzyno"` from Katarzyna

#### Last Name Vocative

The last name declined with gender-appropriate title.

**Variables:** `{{last_name}}`, `{{full_name}}`, `{{position}}`
**Czech example:** `"pane Blaťáku"` / `"paní Blaťáková"`

---

## Smart Variable Selection

Pick only the variables relevant to the personalization type:

| Personalization | Variables | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Website hook | `{{company_name}}`, `{{website_text_summary}}`, `{{linkedin_company_description}}` | User wants hook based on company website (LinkedIn as fallback) |
| LinkedIn company hook | `{{company_name}}`, `{{linkedin_company_description}}` | User wants hook from LinkedIn company page |
| Combined company hook | `{{company_name}}`, `{{company_website}}`, `{{linkedin_company_description}}`, `{{website_text_summary}}` | User wants the richest company-based hook |
| Experience hook | `{{full_name}}`, `{{position}}`, `{{linkedin_about_me}}`, `{{present_experiences}}` | User wants hook about the person's background |
| LinkedIn posts icebreaker | `{{linkedin_latest_posts}}` | User wants hook from recent LinkedIn activity |
| Education/skills hook | `{{full_name}}`, `{{education_summary}}`, `{{linkedin_skills}}` | User wants hook about expertise/education |
| Salutation (any language) | `{{full_name}}`, `{{position}}` | User wants formal greeting in specific language |
| First name vocative | `{{first_name}}` | User wants declined first name |
| Last name vocative | `{{last_name}}`, `{{full_name}}`, `{{position}}` | User wants declined last name with title |

## Prompt Writing Guidelines for Personalization

### Rules for All Personalization Prompts

1. **Enforce word limit.** Every prompt must include: "Keep your output under 16 words."
   This is the single most important rule — it controls hallucination.

2. **Natural tone.** Output should sound like something a human would write in an email.
   Never salesy, never robotic. Conversational and genuine.

3. **Sentence fragment, not a full sentence.** Hooks are parts of a larger message.
   They don't need to be grammatically complete on their own.

4. **Fallback for missing data.** Always include: "If there is not enough information,
   return empty string."

5. **No output format instructions.** The system prompt handles JSON formatting.
   Never ask for `classification:`, `result:`, or any custom format.

6. **One task per prompt.** Each AI column does one personalization. Don't combine
   a hook + salutation in a single prompt.

7. **Language instruction.** For non-English output, add at the end:
   "Write your output in {language}." This goes AFTER the input variables.

### Rules for Hooks (Company & Person)

- Reference something **specific** from the input — never generic
- Bad: "I see your company is doing great things" (too vague)
- Good: "I saw your company helps SaaS teams reduce churn with AI" (specific)
- Start with natural openers: "I saw...", "I noticed...", "With your...", "Given your..."
- The hook will be followed by a transition phrase the user controls — don't add one
- Focus on business-relevant content — skip personal/vacation/birthday mentions

### Rules for Vocatives and Salutations

- Include explicit declension rules with examples in the prompt
- Include gender detection logic (name endings, position keywords)
- For Czech: masculine names typically end in consonant, feminine in -a/-á/-e
- Provide fallback for ambiguous names: use the more formal/neutral option
- Never use diminutive forms — always formal/standard vocative

## Multi-Language System

### How Language Selection Works

1. **User specifies the language** in their request: "website hook in German", "Czech salutation",
   "icebreaker in Polish"
2. **Default is English** — if no language specified, output is in English
3. **For hooks**: append `"Write your output in {language}."` at the end of the prompt
4. **For vocatives/salutations**: use the language-specific template with built-in grammar rules

### Language Capabilities

| Language | Hooks | Salutation | First Name Vocative | Last Name Vocative |
|----------|-------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| English | ✅ | N/A (no formal address convention) | N/A | N/A |
| Czech | ✅ | ✅ (Dobrý den, pane/paní) | ✅ (5. pád) | ✅ (5. pád) |
| Polish | ✅ | ✅ (Szanowny Panie/Pani) | ✅ (wołacz) | ✅ (wołacz) |
| Slovak | ✅ | ✅ (Dobrý deň, pán/pani) | ✅ (5. pád) | ✅ (5. pád) |
| German | ✅ | ✅ (Sehr geehrter Herr/Frau) | N/A | N/A |
| French | ✅ | ✅ (Cher Monsieur/Madame) | N/A | N/A |
| Spanish | ✅ | ✅ (Estimado Sr./Sra.) | N/A | N/A |
| Any other | ✅ | Ask user for format | Ask user for rules | Ask user for rules |

### Auto-Generating Salutation with Hooks

**IMPORTANT: Whenever a user requests any hook or personalization in a specific language,
ALWAYS auto-generate the salutation column for that language too.** The salutation is a
fundamental part of any outreach — the user should never have to ask for it separately.

**Automatic behavior when user requests a hook in any language:**
1. Generate the requested hook column (e.g., `Website Hook - DE`)
2. **Automatically also generate** the salutation column (e.g., `DE Salutation`)
3. Preview both together so the user sees the full opening of their email

**For languages with vocatives (Czech, Polish, Slovak) — also auto-generate:**
- `{LANG} Salutation` — complete formal greeting (always)
- `{LANG} First Name Vocative` — declined first name
- `{LANG} Last Name Vocative` — declined last name with title

**For languages without vocatives (German, French, Spanish, English) — auto-generate:**
- `{LANG} Salutation` — formal greeting with Herr/Frau, Monsieur/Madame, Sr./Sra.

The user can opt out of auto-generating salutations by saying "just the hook" or "no salutation".

## Workflow Step by Step

### Step 1: Collect Input

Gather `project_id`, `api_key`, personalization request, and target language.
If the user doesn't provide a `column_name`, generate one from the type + language.

### Step 2: Determine Personalization Type

Based on the user's request, decide:

1. **What type?** → Company hook, Person hook, Icebreaker, Salutation, or Vocative
2. **Which variables?** → Select from the Smart Variable Selection table
3. **Which language?** → Default English, or user-specified language
4. **Auto-include salutation**: If the user requests any hook in a non-English language,
   automatically also prepare the salutation column for that language (see Auto-Generating
   Salutation with Hooks section). For vocative languages, also include vocative columns.

### Step 3: Write the Prompt

Build the prompt following the guidelines:
1. Clear task definition
2. Word limit rule (≤14 words for hooks)
3. Specific rules for tone, style, and content
4. Fallback for missing data
5. Input variables (only the relevant ones)
6. Language instruction if non-English

### Step 4: Show Prompt to User

Before calling the API, show:
- The column name
- The full prompt text
- The target language

Ask for approval before proceeding.

### Step 5: Preview — Test on First 5 Rows

**Always run a preview before launching.** This lets the user verify the personalization
works correctly before applying it to all contacts.

#### 5a. Submit the preview request

```
POST https://app.leadspicker.com/app/sb/api/projects/{project_id}/ai-prompt-preview/
```

Body:
```json
{
  "column_name": "{column_name}",
  "prompt": "{prompt_text_with_escaped_newlines}",
  "is_boolean": false
}
```

#### 5b. Fetch contact data for context

```
GET https://app.leadspicker.com/app/sb/api/projects/{project_id}/people?page=1&page_size=5
```

#### 5c. Fetch preview results

Wait a few seconds, then:
```
GET https://app.leadspicker.com/app/sb/api/projects/{project_id}/ai-prompt-preview/?column_name={column_name}&is_boolean=false
```

#### 5d. Present combined preview

Show a table combining contact data with personalization output:

```
Preview Results (first 5 rows):

| Name | Position | Company | Result |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Tomáš Blaťák | Sales Manager | Leadspicker | Dobrý den, pane Blaťáku |
| Jana Nováková | CEO | Acme s.r.o. | Dobrý den, paní Nováková |
...

Does this look correct? Should I launch for all contacts?
```

#### 5e. Wait for user approval

- If approved → proceed to Step 6
- If changes needed → go back to Step 3
- If cancel → stop

### Step 6: Launch Full Personalization

```
POST https://app.leadspicker.com/app/sb/api/projects/{project_id}/magic-columns
```

```json
{
  "magic_column_type": "ai_custom_column",
  "column_name": "{column_name}",
  "prompt": "{prompt_text_with_escaped_newlines}",
  "is_boolean": false
}
```

### Step 7: Report and Suggest Next Steps

After successful creation:
- Confirm the column was created
- Suggest related personalizations:
  - After website hook → "Want a LinkedIn company hook too?"
  - After icebreaker → "Want a hook based on their experience?"
  - After salutation → "Want first name and last name vocatives too?"
  - After CZ columns → "Want hooks in Czech as well?"

## Batch Mode — Personalization Pipeline

When the user asks for "full personalization" or "all hooks":

### English Personalization Package

```
Column 1: Website Hook
Column 2: Company Hook (LinkedIn)
Column 3: Experience Hook
Column 4: Icebreaker (LinkedIn Posts)
```

### Czech Personalization Package

```
Column 1: Website Hook - CZ
Column 2: Company Hook - CZ
Column 3: Experience Hook - CZ
Column 4: Icebreaker - CZ
Column 5: CZ Salutation
Column 6: CZ First Name Vocative
Column 7: CZ Last Name Vocative
```

### Any Language Package

```
Column 1: Website Hook - {LANG}
Column 2: Company Hook - {LANG}
Column 3: Experience Hook - {LANG}
Column 4: Icebreaker - {LANG}
Column 5: {LANG} Salutation (if applicable)
Column 6: {LANG} First Name Vocative (if applicable)
Column 7: {LANG} Last Name Vocative (if applicable)
```

Execute all columns sequentially with 1-second delay between API calls.
Preview the first column to verify quality, then launch all after approval.

## Error Handling

| HTTP Status | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Bad or expired API key | Verify `x-api-key` with user |
| `404 Not Found` | Wrong `project_id` | Verify project ID |
| `400 Bad Request` | Malformed body or invalid type | Check JSON formatting |
| `422 Unprocessable` | Column name already exists | Use a different column name |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit on batch | Increase delay between calls to 2-3s |

## Security

- **Never log or display** the full API key — confirm only the last 6 characters
- Use the API key only for Leadspicker API calls, never send it elsewhere
- Before calling the API, **always show the prompt to the user** for approval
- Write all prompts in English for best GPT-4o-Mini performance (add language output instruction at the end)
